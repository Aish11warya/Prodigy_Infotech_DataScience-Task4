## DATASETS
The dataset used for this project consists of Twitter entity sentiment data collected from github.

## METHODOLOGY
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed duplicates, stopwords, special characters, and performed tokenization.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed sentiment distribution across different topics and entities.

- Modeling & Visualization: Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and created visualizations to represent sentiment trends.

## KEY FINDINGS
- Negative sentiments are more common compared to positive ones.

- Positive and neutral sentiments still make up a large portion of the data.

- Certain topics/brands trigger stronger emotional reactions than others.

- Sentiment distribution varies across time, showing shifts in public opinion.

## CONCLUSION
The sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into public attitudes and opinions within the Twitter community. While negative sentiments dominate, there is still a diverse range of emotions expressed across different topics. These findings are useful for businesses, policymakers, and organizations to monitor brand perception, track public opinion, and make data-driven decisions.
